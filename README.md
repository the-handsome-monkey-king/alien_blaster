# alien_blaster
A top-down shooter game written with Allegro 4, C, and C++

This game was created as a project for a practical game development course for Athabasca University in 2018. All aspects of this game will fall under the GNU general license of this project except those created by others, whose licenses are listed in the game document. For simplicity, the final version of this project is presented as version 1.0.

Version 1.5 will consist of a refactoring of the code base to make it more in line with good software practices This version will not make any changes to assests or gameplay, it will be a re-designing and implementation of the simple game engine I created for the game to align with better development practices.
